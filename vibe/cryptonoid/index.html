          <p><strong>Published:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>
          <p>This is my very first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts with the world. Writing has always been a passion of mine, and this simple blog gives me a place to express my ideas and connect with others who share similar interests.</p>
          <p>I chose to keep this blog simple and clean, focusing on the content rather than flashy design elements. Sometimes the best approach is the most straightforward one.</p>

        <summary>Thoughts on Web Development</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> August 2, 2025</p>
          <p>Web development has evolved tremendously over the years. From simple HTML pages to complex applications, the journey has been fascinating to witness and be part of.</p>
          <p>One thing I've learned is that sometimes the simplest solutions are the most elegant. You don't always need JavaScript frameworks for everything - sometimes pure HTML and CSS can accomplish exactly what you need.</p>
          <p>This blog itself is a perfect example: collapsible sections without a single line of JavaScript, just using the native <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements.</p>

        <summary>The Beauty of Minimalism</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> August 1, 2025</p>
          <p>In a world filled with noise and complexity, there's something refreshing about minimalism. Whether it's in design, lifestyle, or technology, stripping away the unnecessary can help us focus on what truly matters.</p>
          <p>This philosophy applies to web design too. Clean typography, thoughtful spacing, and intuitive navigation often create more impactful experiences than cluttered layouts with countless features.</p>
          <p>Less can indeed be more, and this simple blog is my attempt to embrace that principle.</p>

        <summary>Learning Never Stops</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>Published:</strong> July 30, 2025</p>
          <p>Every day brings new opportunities to learn and grow. Whether it's mastering a new programming concept, exploring a different perspective, or simply observing the world around us, there's always something to discover.</p>
          <p>I find that the best learning happens when we stay curious and open-minded. Questions are more valuable than answers, and admitting what we don't know is the first step toward genuine understanding.</p>
          <p>This blog will serve as my learning journal, documenting insights and reflections along the way.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>About the Design:</strong></p>
          <p>This blog is intentionally simple and lightweight. It uses semantic HTML with <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> elements to create collapsible sections without requiring JavaScript.</p>
          <p>The design is fully responsive using relative units (em) for consistent scaling across different devices and screen sizes. The font stack includes Comic Sans MS as a primary choice with appropriate fallbacks for better compatibility.</p>
          <p>Everything is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring the blog works well with screen readers and keyboard navigation.</p>
