      <b>I</b> tried Lab's feature to vibe-code came for the first time, here it's how it went.
      Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted the thread, and kept only finished game, so here is what I remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>G</b>oal was to create Arcanoid-like game, where the "obstacle" would not be brick wall, but orderbook from some crypto exchange.
      In total, I finished with something reasonable in 3 prompts, you can see it <a href="CryptoBreakers/index.html">here</a>.
      Each prompt took about 10 minutes, which wrote also some python code (which is weird that it's web game in javascript).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F</b>irst version stacked orderbook vertically -- i.e. there were 2 columns, 1 for bids, 1 for asks.
      Also, also game was always showing "loading" overlay, but working.
      I asked to show order book price levels side by side, not stack them vertically.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>A</b>fter 10 minutes, I got improved game.
      "Loading screen" bug was fixed without me asking for it, but still there were things to fixed.
      There was very narrow gap between the ship and blocks, so you would loose quickly.
      I asked to align pricelevels to the top, so there is even more gap between ship and blocks.
      I asked for each price-level to be split into boxes that are vertically stacked (originally I told it to have single tall box, but it turns out to be silly).
      Finally, there was visual bug and bids and asks were overlayed, I asked perplexity to fix it.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>A</b>fter another 10 minutes, I got final game <a href="CryptoBreakers/index.html">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C</b>losing thoughts:
      It was pretty fun exercise.
      I have not reviewed code properly at the time of writing, but game seems to works at least a little.
      Also, with each version, it produced very fluffy description of what it did.
      Overstating achievements, making it look like ground-breaking changes.
      I believe perplexity would not be lost in the corporate world :-D
